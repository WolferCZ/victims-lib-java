# Repository

This package contains classes responsible for managing data (CRUD) obtained from Victim API.

The package it self should contain only minimal set of interfaces required for data management
and packages with implementation for specific technology (JDBC database/Lucine/JPA/XML etc.).

The individual packages should export minimal set of implementation/factory classes.
