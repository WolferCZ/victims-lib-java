# Configuration

This folder contains java interfaces for POJO configuration files.

All services and utils in this library, witch require specific configuration,
will utilize only provided interfaces from this package.

The library is not responsible for implementation of these interfaces.
Although some skeleton implementation will be necessary for testing purposes.
This test implementation may be also use as examples or documentation purposes (e.g. Asciidoc).
